            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thought this day to have welcomed You with an honourable Peace; My preparations for the War, and Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at the Treaty, gave Me great reaſon to believe ſo: but the <hi>Dutch</hi> have diſappointed Me in that expectation, and have treated My Ambaſſadors at <hi>Cologne,</hi> with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Conquerors, and not as might be expected from men in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>They have other thoughts then Peace.</p>
            <p>This obligeth Me to move you again for a Supply, the Safety and Honor of the Nation neceſſarily requiring it: It muſt be one proportionable to the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103454:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 45 -->and I muſt tell you beſides, that if I have it not ſpeedily, the Miſchief will be irreparable in My preparations for the next Spring: The Great Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I have had of you Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, will not ſuffer Me to believe, that the Artifices of Our Enemies can poſsibly divert you from giving Me this Supply, or that you can fail of adjuſting the proportion of it.</p>
            <p>I hope I need not uſe many words to perſwade you, that I am ſteady in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all the Profeſsions and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes I have made you concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Property: And I ſhall be very ready to give you freſh inſtances of My Zeal, for preſerving the establiſhed Religion and Lawes, as often as any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall require.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, I am highly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to commend to your Conſideration and Care the Debt I owe the <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths,</hi> in which very many other of My good Subjects are involved; I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily recommend their condition to you, and deſire your aſsiſtance for their relief.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103454:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 46 -->to be refuſed. He could not be <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> without ſecuring the <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> of His <hi>Own Seas;</hi> The firſt by an Article clear, and not eluſory of the <hi>Flagg;</hi> The other by an Article, that preſerved the <hi>right</hi> of the <hi>Fiſhing,</hi> but gave the <hi>Dutch</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as Tenants, under a ſmall Rent, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and continue that <hi>gainful Trade</hi> upon His Coaſts. <hi>The King</hi> was obliged, for the <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of a laſting Peace, as alſo by the Laws of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and <hi>Relation,</hi> to ſee the <hi>Houſe of Orange</hi> ſetled, and the <hi>Lovestein,</hi> that <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> party, brought down. Neither in this did the <hi>King</hi> inſiſt beyond what was moderate, and agreeable to their Government: And what the Prince's anceſtors enjoyed amongſt them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, there was neceſſary to the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> that there ſhould be a fair <hi>Adjustment</hi> of <hi>Commerce</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> where the Kings Demands were <hi>reaſonalbe,</hi> and according to the <hi>Law of Nations;</hi> and <hi>their Practice</hi> of late years hath been <hi>Exorbitant,</hi> and <hi>Oppreſsive,</hi> ſuitable on ely to their Power and Intereſt, and <hi>destructive,</hi> if continued, to our <hi>East-India-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi> Theſe were all, of any moment, the King inſiſted on; as judging aright, That that <hi>Peace</hi> that was <hi>reaſonable, juſt,</hi> and <hi>fair</hi> to both parties, would be <hi>ſacred</hi> and <hi>durable.</hi> And that by this means, He ſhould depreſs the Intereſt, and Reputation of that <hi>Loveſtein</hi> party amongſt them, who ſucked in with their milk an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate hatred to <hi>England,</hi> and tranſmit it to

               <!-- PDF PAGE 46 -->their poſterity, as a <hi>diſtinguiſhing Character;</hi> wherein they place their <hi>Loyalty</hi> to their <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In return to this <hi>Candid,</hi> and <hi>fair proceeding on the Kings part,</hi> His Majeſty aſſures you, he hath received <hi>nothing,</hi> but the moſt <hi>ſcornful,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous treatment</hi> imaginable; Papers deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in to the <hi>Mediators,</hi> owned by them to be ſtuffed with ſo unhandſome Language, that they were <hi>aſhamed,</hi> and <hi>refuſed</hi> to ſhew them: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver agreeing to any Article about the <hi>Flagg,</hi> that was clear or plain: Refuſing any Article of the <hi>Fiſhing,</hi> but ſuch a one, as might ſell them the right of Inheritance, for an inconſiderable ſum of money, though it be a <hi>Royalty</hi> ſo <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the Crown of England,</hi> that I may ſay, (with His Majeſties pardon for the Expreſsion) He cannot ſell it. The Article of the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> and the <hi>Adjuſtment</hi> of the <hi>East India-Trade</hi> had neither of them any better ſucceſs; And to make all of a piece, they have this laſt week ſent a Trumpetter with an <hi>Addreſs</hi> to <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> being a deduction of their ſeveral <hi>Offers</hi> of <hi>Peace, as they call them,</hi> and their deſires for it now; but it is both in the Penning and the Timeing of it, plainly an <hi>Appeal</hi> to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties People againſt Himſelf; And the King hath commanded me to tell you, He is reſolved to joyn iſſue with them, and Print both their <hi>Addreſs,</hi> and His <hi>Anſwer,</hi> that His People and the World may ſee how notorious <hi>falſhoods</hi> and <hi>ſlights</hi> they endeavour to put upon Him:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103454:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 47 -->In a word, in <hi>England,</hi> and in all <hi>other Places,</hi> and to all <hi>other Perſons</hi> of the World, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare they <hi>offer all things</hi> to obtain a Peace from the King of <hi>England:</hi> But to <hi>Himſelf,</hi> His <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> the <hi>Mediators,</hi> or <hi>His Plenipotentiaries,</hi> it may with confidence and truth be affirmed, that to this day; nay, even in this laſt Addreſs they have <hi>offered nothing.</hi> They deſire the Kings Subjects would believe they <hi>beg</hi> for <hi>Peace,</hi> whilſt their <hi>true requeſt</hi> is, onely to be permitted to be once <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Seas;</hi> Which they hope, if they can ſubſiſt at Land, length of time may give them: And if once <hi>got,</hi> is never to be <hi>lost;</hi> Nor can it be <hi>bought</hi> by any State or Empire, <hi>at too great a rate.</hi> And what Security their <hi>Agreement</hi> with us <hi>in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> will afford, when they ſhall have the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, former Inſtances may give <hi>Demonstration of.

            </p>
            <p>This being the true and natural ſtate of things, His <hi>Majesty</hi> doth with great <hi>aſſurance</hi> throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Arms <hi>of You His Parliament,</hi> for <hi>a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> ſuitable to this great Affair He is engaged in.

            </p>
            <p>As for the next part of the <hi>Kings Speech,</hi> I can add nothing to what His Majeſty hath ſaid. For as to <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> His <hi>heart</hi> is with your <hi>heart, perfectly with your heart.</hi> He hath not yet learned to deny you any thing; and He believes your <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> is ſuch, He never ſhall. He asks of you to be at <hi>Peace in Him,</hi> as He is <hi>in You,</hi> and He ſhall <hi>never deceive you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is one word more, I am commanded to ſay concerning that <hi>Debt</hi> is owing to the <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths.</hi> The King holds himſelf in <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> obliged to ſee them ſatisfied.

               <lb/>
I have no more in Command, and therefore ſhall conclude with my own hearty Prayers, That this <hi>Seſsion</hi> may <hi>equal,</hi> nay <hi>exceed</hi> the Honour of the laſt; That it may perfect what the laſt begun for the <hi>Safety of this King,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom;</hi> That it may be ever famous for having eſtabliſhed, upon a durable Foundation, our <hi>Religion, Laws, and Properties;</hi> That we may not be toſſed with <hi>boiſterous Winds,</hi> nor overtaken by a <hi>ſudden dead Calm:</hi> But that a <hi>gentle fair Gale</hi> may carry you in a ſteady, even, and reſolved way into the Ports of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Security.</hi>
